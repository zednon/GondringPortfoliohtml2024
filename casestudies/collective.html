            </strong>In the game Hades Star there is a corporation called The Collective, its a very old corporation I have been a member for 4 years. In Nov. there was a large update to the game. Player base dropped drastically. I worked with my team of leaders to develop new ways to keep people engaged with the corp and the game. The Collective over the years has had over hunderd active memebers. At this time the numbers have droped to about 40 players in The Collective however our server hosts </p>

                A bit of a overview of the game, Hades Star came out of beta in August 21, 2017 and was released globally.  Players develop their own star systems called Yellow Stars.  Players spend years developing these systems. Exploring space developing the planets. Players join corporations with other players who help them develop their systems.  </p>
                <p>
                There is another star type called a Red Star, it's a Player vs Environment (Non-player charters). These matches take about 10 mins and need to be run once a day. It's how players develop their tech as the game progresses there are different levels to the game. The end game is Dark Red Star 12, however no one has this unlocked at this time, the highest people are in the game a present is level Dark Red Star 11. 
            </p>
                <p>
                An other star type is a Blue Star. This is a Player vs Player match that takes roughly 3 mins in Battle Royal Style Game. Players are matched up based on tech levels.  </p>
                <p>
                The final star type is called a White Star. It's a Player vs Player game that includes Asynchronous co-operation, slow down time, and spawns five days. The matchs our 10 players from one team and 10 from another. Theyâ€™re in-depth straghy players/teams have developed over the years to create changes over the years. </p>
                <p>
                This game is played on mobile, desktop, and x-box. Most users play on their desktop, while others play only on there phones. Discord is often used for commutation outside of the game. Where friendships are developed with people inside the corps And at least one marrage has taken place from meet within the game. </p>
                <p>Please visit my vidoe page to view the game, most of the videos I have made are about the this game.

            <p>White Star changed drasticly, there used to be rewards with the release of the update to the game these rewards where done away with for the personal player instend the corp got a bonus, ad to arts the player would pick up in red stars.</p>

<p> My orders page is for cat memes only. It forces my players to talk to each other. If there is a big event that the whole teams needs to be aware of then orders well be given.</p>

<p>Most leaders in the game give alot of orders to players, and the players begain to relay on these orders and no longer watch the game.</p>
