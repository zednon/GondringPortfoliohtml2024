<h2>Working on tasks eariler in the week</h2><br></br>
<p>The rest of the team wanted to wait until the vidoes that were recorded for 
  one of the work shops where done before they would review the emails.
  I had to work with the team to get them to review the emails before 
  the videos where even recorded since I just needed a link to place on the emails. 
  I resured them I felt they where else to do there job and I would be able to
  get the video's upload by the due date.

<p>Having a background in solical service where there is heavy documation

  to speak with the CEO and explain that I needed the content by a certain 
  date. He became more aware of the time line started to adjust his work habbits
  so the team was more effective in getting the needed content finished eariler.

<h2>Automations</h2><br></br>
<p>Having emails done eariler ment I needed a proces for automations. 
  the way I was taught was to develop a new audomtions for each email, each week. 
  I was able to work with the team to develop a new process where I would 
  make one automation for each email and then just add the new email to the
  end of the automation with a the date set for the next time the email would go out. 
  It helped keep me on track and on time as well since I never wanted to 
  loss my automations and have to start over. Plus I liked the record of 
  the emails that had gone out for easy review.

<h2>Emails On Time</h2><br></br>
<p>By working with the team to develop new work habbits I was able to 
  get the emails out on time. Work loads also shift to easy pressure 
  such doing one newsletter each week instend of two. The CEO also 
  started to work with the team to get content to me on time. Relizing 
  that I was able to get the emails out on time if he was able to get 
  me the need information eariler in the week.

  <h2>Training my replacement</h2><br></br>
  <p>I was able to train my replacement on how to use the new process 
    for automations. I also was able to train her on how to use the 
    new email builder that was being used. I also told her emails were
    due the day before they went out so she had time to review them
    and make changes if needed. Also the CEO and other staff often gave 
    last minute emails that had to go out right away. She was able to understand 
    the time sensive of getting work done on time.
