    I recently read an article in Wiley’s Online Library about Neurodiversity, Gender, and Work. I’ll share the link to the article at the bottom so you can explore it too. As a woman with both ADHD and dyslexia, this topic is deeply personal to me. Growing up, I often felt like the odd one out because these conditions were frequently seen as “boy problems.” I was often the only girl in the room dealing with them.
<br><br>
The article confirms my experiences that women with neurodiversity’s are often overlooked in research data. Despite 15–20% of the population being neurodivergent — encompassing conditions like ADHD, autism, learning disabilities, and Tourette’s syndrome — diagnostic rates are skewed because…… For ADHD, autism spectrum conditions, and Tourette’s syndrome, three males are diagnosed for every one female. Similarly, boys are diagnosed with learning disabilities two to five times more often than girls. This disparity doesn’t exist for other disabilities like blindness or deafness, suggesting that girls with neurodivergent conditions are significantly underdiagnosed because….. Early intervention is critical for all disabilities, and neurodiversity is no exception.
<br><br>
One reason for this underdiagnosis is behavioral differences. Boys often externalize their symptoms, acting out in ways that draw attention. Girls, on the other hand, tend to internalize their struggles, often accompanied by anxiety, making their symptoms less noticeable. For example, a girl with ADHD might appear quiet, daydream a lot, or struggle to focus without causing classroom disruptions. She may need music to help her concentrate or exhibit difficulties with organization. These subtler signs can be overlooked because they don’t fit the stereotypical “hyperactive” behavior associated with ADHD. The research also reveals that girls will often engage in masking behaviors to hide their so called “divergencies” so that they can fit in. Masking behaviors are often exhausting, causing them to expend all of their attention and focus on concealing their differences.
<br><br>
This issue extends to learning disabilities. For example, a teacher might overlook a girl’s challenges with dyscalculia (e.g., not understanding a clock face) or dyslexia (e.g., reversing letters at an age where this should no longer occur) and dismiss these struggles as simply “ a motivational problem or a lack of effort.
<br><br>
As girls grow older, masking — hiding their symptoms — becomes more challenging. Societal expectations also play a role. Traits like restlessness and fidgeting are often seen as more socially acceptable in boys than in girls. A restless boy might just be considered “boyish,” while a girl exhibiting the same behavior might be judged more harshly. Similarly, in social contexts, women with neurodiverse conditions might struggle more because small talk and nuanced social interactions — skills often expected of women — can be difficult for them.

<br><br>
Media portrayals add to this misunderstanding. Growing up, I noticed that neurodiverse characters, especially those with learning disabilities, were often depicted negatively. A typical trope was the “frustrated, undiagnosed boy acting out and bullying others.” As a quiet, book-loving girl who relied on audiobooks, I felt invisible because none of these portrayals reflected my experience. Neurodiverse women are rarely represented in film, and when neurodiverse characters appear, their intelligence and creativity are often overlooked in favor of highlighting their struggles. For example, a dyslexic person might be shown as someone who “can’t read” instead of as someone building robots or excelling in other areas. Fortunately, there are now a steady stream of YouTube videos representing the experiences of neurodiverse women and girls. Each story is unique, however what unites them is the theme of feeling invisible.
<br><br>
<strong>What can we do?</strong>
</p>
<br><br>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Focus on early intervention:</strong> Teachers should be trained to recognize neurodivergent traits in girls (such as difficulty writing coherently, anxiety, and social exclusion) and refer them for both social-emotional and academic support.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong>Challenge gendered communication norms: </strong>Not every woman thrives on small talk, just as not every man struggles. We must embrace different communication styles. Continue to share the personal anecdotes of neurodivergent women using social media platforms and documenting their narratives through qualitative research.</li>  <br><br>  <li><strong>Promote acceptance:</strong> Recognize that neurodiverse individuals, regardless of gender, bring unique and much-needed perspectives to a wide array of topics. Women with neurodiverse conditions may exhibit traits similar to their male counterparts (or they may not), and that’s perfectly fine.</li>

</ol>
<br><br>
<p>Finally, workplaces should appreciate the unique strengths of neurodiverse individuals. Many of us have developed exceptional problem-solving skills from navigating a world with few accommodations. This resiliency and creativity make neurodiverse people invaluable team members who can think outside the box and devise innovative solutions to complex problems.
